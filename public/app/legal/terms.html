                <p>
                    I understand that during my participation in any Air Bears training, practice, drill, demonstration, deployment, or other event, I may be exposed to a variety of hazards and risks, foreseen or unforeseen, which are inherent in each Event and cannot be eliminated, without destroying the unique character and purpose of the Event. These inherent risks include, but are not limited to the dangers of serious personal, injury, property damage, and death (“injuries and damages”) from exposure to the hazards of travel and the outdoors and the operation of RC equipment. Air Bears has not tried to contradict or minimize my understanding of these risks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know that Injuries and Damages can occur by natural causes or activities or because of other reasons. I understand that risks of such Injuries and Damages are involved in Search and Rescue activities such as Air Bear Events including practices and real events and i appreciate that I may have to exercise extra care for my own person and for others around me in the face of such hazards. I further understand that on my Air Bear Event there may not be rescue or medical facilities or expertise necessary to deal with the Injuries and Damages to which I may be exposed. In consideration for my acceptance as a participant in an Air Bear Event, I confirm my understanding that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is my responsibility to read any rules and conditions applicable to the Event made available to me and I acknowledge my participation is at the discretion of the leader.</li>
                    <li>The Air Bear Event officially begins and ends at the location(s) designated by local authorities . The Event does not include carpooling, transportation, or transit to and from the Event, and I am personally responsible for all the risks associated with this travel. This does not apply to transportation provided by Air Bear during the Event.</li>
                    <li>If I decide to leave early and not to complete the Event as planned, I assume all risks inherent in my decision to leave and waive all liability against Air Bear arising from that decision. Likewise, if the local authorities have concluded the Event, and I decide to go forward without the leader, I assume all risks inherent in my decision to go forward and waive all liability against Air Bear arising from that decision.</li>
                    <li>This amendment is intended to be a broad and inclusive as is permitted by law. If any provision or any part of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or legally unenforceable for any reason, the remainder of this agreement shall not be affected thereby and shall remain valid and fully enforceable.</li>
                    <li>To the fullest extent allowed by law, I agree to WAIVE, DISCHARGE CLAIMS, AND RELEASE FROM LIABILITY Air Bears, its officers, directors, employees, agents, leaders, members and volunteers from by negligence of Air Bears, its officers, directors, employees, agents, leaders, members and volunteers in any way connected with the Event. I further agree to HOLD HARMLESS Air Bears, its officers, directors, employees, agents, leaders, members and volunteers from any claims, damages, injuries or losses caused by my own negligence while a participant in the Event. I understand and intend that this assumption of risk and release is bringing upon my heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, and includes any minors accompanying me on the Event.</li>
